Enhancing Dengue Outbreak Prediction in Bangladesh: A Weighted Average Ensemble Machine Learning Approach

The research paper, originally developed as part of my undergraduate thesis and later extended, is currently under review. The study analyzes dengue datasets from Bangladesh and applies multiple machine learning models to predict dengue outbreaks, aiming to enhance early detection and prevention strategies.
